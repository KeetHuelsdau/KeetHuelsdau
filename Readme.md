## About me


## My Hobbies
playing the alto saxophone, rowing

## Work
In 2008, I completed my Bachelor of Business Administration with a focus on hotel management 
in Maastricht (NL). After that, I worked mainly in internal sales for various companies before 
I started studying for a Bachelor of Computer Science at the FernUniversit√§t in Hagen in the 
winter semester of 2020. Since I lacked practical relevance in my studies, I applied for the 
programme at Academic Work in cooperation with Finanz Informatik, which I started now in 
September 2023
